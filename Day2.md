# introduction to Linux
Linux is an open source operating system kernel.
What is kernel?
kernel is a code/program that used to meet your software and hardware and allocate some resources.
## history of Linux
In 1969, a team led by computer scientists ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the first version of UNIX on PDP-7 microcomputer. But, it wasn't cheap and open-source.
Then a person called "Linus Torvalds" created the Linux kernel and posted it online to make it open-source
Richard Stallman announced the GNU project in 1983 and confounded the free software foundation  in 1985.
GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIX OS, but it was just software replacement not full OS {examples: bash, tar, emacs...}
so GNU + LINUX will give the GNU/LINUX OS.
The GNU Linux project was started to create a UNIX-like operating system created with a source code that could be copied, modified, and redistributed.
#### what is shell?
users communicate with the kernel by the shell.
the shell is a command line interpreter which translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the kernel.
##### Types of shells:
based on their features there are many shells:
     - SH
     - BASH
     - ZSH
     - FISH
they differ in Coloring, Piping, command compilation, and some kind of features.
-To identify your shell: "echo $SHELL"
### What is operating system (OS)?
we have said that UNIX and GNU/Linux as OS .
OS is the main software part of computer that helps to work on.
it contains:
   - kernel
   - Software
   - desktop environment(e.g.: mate, gnome, KDE plasma)
   - file extensions
   - window manager(e.g.: i3-window manager)
#### why Linux?
- Linux is faster and no high space needed.
- Most hacking systems are operated on Linux.
- Linux is **most secured.
- 47% of professional developers use Linux-based operating systems.
- Linux powers 39.2% of website whose operating system is known.
- Linux powers 85% of smart phones.
- The world's top 500 fastest super computers all run on Linux.
- Today, there are over 800 active Linux distros.
#### Linux distributions/distro
Distro is modified Linux kernels, type of operating system with different:
        -Linux kernel
        -packages(GNU)
        -package manager
        -Desktop UI
Examples of Distros:
  - Debian-->kali Linux, ubuntu and parrot
  - Arch-->Black, arch and Garuda
  - Fedora
  - Red hat
  - Gentoo
  - Android â€¦etc...
##### Kali Linux
is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. it is maintained and funded by offensive security.
it's: -desktop environment-->xfce
     -package manager-->apt
     -shell: 
##### parrot OS
is a Linux distribution based on Debian with a focus on security, privacy and development.
 -Desktop Environment: mate
 -package manager: apt
 -shell: bash
##### Garuda
is a Linux distribution based on the Arch Linux operating system.
 -Desktop Environment: KDE plasma
 -package manager: pacman
 -shell: fish
#### Do Windows have distros??
Windows is not open-source so peoples won't use / edit it, so there won't be other kind.
It just give updates and adds some features on it.
### Methods to use Linux:
 - as Main OS/ main-boot
 - Dual-boot/ 2 in 1
 - Virtualization
 -  WSL V2/ windows subsystems for Linux
N.B: Virtualization: a method to use Windows and Linux together.
softwares that gives you this ability:
    -Hyber V
    -QEMU
    -Virtual Box-Oracle
    -VMware .etc.
